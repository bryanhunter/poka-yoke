Poka-yoke: mistake proofing via functional programming

Slides and code. Each version is in a branch named after the conference or event where it was 
presented (e.g. "fnconf17")

## Abstract
"Poka yoke‚Äù (po-kah yo-kay) is a term from Japanese manufacturing that means "mistake proofing". 
It is a powerful concept (equally powerful in software) in which the design of a system shapes 
usage so that human error is prevented or corrected before it can cause real harm. In this session 
we will explore how and why FP maps so well onto the poka yoke concept. We will discuss the merits 
of mistake proofing over diligence, and rethink our approaches to craft and quality. You will 
leave with a new lens to evaluate languages, tools, and your own code. Examples in Elixir, Elm, 
F#, and Idris.
